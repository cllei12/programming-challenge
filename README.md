Summer 2022 Programming Challenge

The specific task will be to create a pipeline that collects and analyzes news articles from the web. Given a short list of curated websites, your script should be able to collect the latest news articles (via web scraping) and run them through some basic sentiment analysis.

## Create a enviroment

Created by conda with Python 3.8+

```python
conda create -n text python=3.8
conda activate text
```


## Collect latest news via web scraping

Collect 10 most recent articles from https://www.aljazeera.com/where/mozambique/ Include collected articles as a JSON file in your submission repository. The format of the file is up to you, describe this format in your summary (see step 6).


### format of the file
- [ ] collect articles as a JSON file in your submission repository. The format of the file is up to you, describe this format in your summary (see step 6).


## Requirements

Create a GitHub repo with a Python 3.8+ environment for this project and start a requirements.txt file to capture the external libraries/packages required to run your code. 

If you use a virtual environment such as conda, specify that in the summary (see step 6). This repository is where you can upload all the files pertaining to your submission.
