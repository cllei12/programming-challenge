This will not mean someone is giving up the city \u2013 no one will give up anything. But it\u2019s possible [they] will be forced to pull back,\u201d he said.\n37 mins ago (08:05 GMT)\nA Russia-appointed official in the partially-occupied southern Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia said a referendum on joining Russia will be held before the end of the year.\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of our region\u2019s residents want to come back to the motherland and become part of big Russia,\u201d Kirill Rogov, a former journalist who is now part of Russia\u2019s administration in the area, was quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency as claiming.\n\u201cThe sooner we become Russia, the faster our lives will improve,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly accused Russia of planning to \u201cfalsify\u201d an independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions.\n41 mins ago (08:01 GMT)\nThe square near the US embassy\u2019s building in Moscow will be named after the separatist \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of Donetsk,\u201d according to Russian media.\nRIA Novosti reported that 45 percent of participants of an online poll voted in favour, while 32 percent voted for it to be named after \u201cThe defenders of Donbas,\u201d the southeastern Ukrainian region partially controlled by pro-Moscow separatists since 2014.\n50 mins ago (07:52 GMT)\nGrain shipments will resume from Ukraine\u2019s Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Berdyansk this week after work was completed to de-mine it, Russia\u2019s TASS news agency has cited local authorities as saying.\nWestern countries have accused Russia of creating the risk of global famine by shutting Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports.

But in October last year officials replaced that label with the \u201cterrorist or extremist\u201d one.\n\u201cI was worried they would demand that I kissed portraits of Putin and learned quotes by Medvedev, but it wasn\u2019t necessary. It is just that my bunk bed now has a label that describes me a terrorist,\u201d Navalny, in his usual sardonic matter, commented on the move at the time in a social media post.\nHe and his defence team filed an appeal contesting the label, but a panel of judges in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region about 100 kilometres east of Moscow on Tuesday rejected the appeal and ruled to keep the designation in place.\n3 hours ago (05:56 GMT)\nAfter forcefully aligning the self-declared administration of occupied Kherson with Russia, Moscow is \u201chighly likely\u201d to claim the region as \u201cevidence\u201d of improving Ukrainian living standards, the UK\u2019s defence ministry has said.\n\u201cIn the occupied Kherson region, Russia is forcibly aligning its administration with that of the Russian Federation by introducing the Russian rouble as legal tender and employing Russian teachers to introduce the Russian curriculum and language to schools,\u201d the ministry said on Twitter.\n\u201cRussia will highly likely claim its occupation of Kherson as evidence of delivering improved governance and living standards to the Ukrainian people,\u201d it added.\nThe ministry also said that Russia has continued to attack Severodonetsk from three directions but it was unlikely either side had gained significant ground in the last 24 hours.\n(1 of 7) pic.twitter.com/xwa311mkdq\n\u2014 Ministry of Defence \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (@DefenceHQ) June 8, 2022\n\n3 hours ago (05:49 GMT)\nNorway has donated 22 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including spare parts, ammunition and other gear, the Norwegian defence ministry has said.\n\u201cThe Norwegian government has waited to publicly announce the donation for security reasons.

The US removed the motorised vessel within an hour or two of the court\u2019s ruling, possibly to ensure the yacht didn\u2019t get entangled in any further legal action.\nAnthony Coley, a spokesman for the US Justice Department, said on Twitter that the superyacht had set sail for the US under a new flag, and that American authorities were grateful to police and prosecutors in Fiji \u201cwhose perseverance and dedication to the rule of law made this action possible\u201d.\nThe court ruling represents a significant victory for the US as it encounters obstacles in its attempts to seize the assets of Russian oligarchs around the world.\nToday, with authorization from the Fijian High Court and under a new flag, the Amadea set sail for the United States after having been seized as the proceeds of criminal evasion of US sanctions against Russian oligarch Suleyman Kerimov.

We saw it in 2014 when Russia initially went at Ukraine and was using information as a weapon of war,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo in that particular instance and in this instance, we\u2019ve actually reversed this on them precisely by using information, real information, to call out what we saw them preparing and working to do,\u201d he added.\nFollowing through on a #YearOfAction commitment made at #SummitForDemocracy, we look forward to becoming @FO_Coalition Chair in 2023.

She spoke in an interview with German journalist and author Alexander Osang televised by broadcaster ARD.\nMerkel said there was no justification for Russia\u2019s \u201cbrutal disregard of international law\u201d in Ukraine, adding that she had been against a plan to let Ukraine into NATO because she wanted to prevent escalation with Russia and Ukraine was not ready for such membership.\n13 hours ago (20:05 GMT)\nRussia has handed over to Kyiv the bodies of 210 Ukrainian fighters, most of whom died defending the city of Mariupol from Russian forces at a vast steelworks, the Ukrainian military said.\n\u201cThe process of returning the bodies of the fallen defenders of Mariupol is under way.

The windows began shattering and we understood right away that the war has begun.\n\u201cOn the first day, the shelling was far from us, on the city\u2019s other side, but every day, it kept getting closer and in the end, it was next to our apartment building. The shrapnel was flying around and we simply couldn\u2019t leave our basement bomb shelter.\n\u201cWe were in shock, my arms, feet were shaking, I said: \u2018Perhaps it\u2019s not true.\u2019 But then we turned the TV on and understood it was, and that the real, full-scale war had begun.\n\u201cThe children were scared from day one, of course, scared of this constant bombardment. But when things got real tense, they just convulsed with hysteria in those basements. And they asked questions: \u2018Does it hurt to die?\u2019\n\u201cMy daughter is eight, my son is six.\n\u201cOur dog is a small chihuahua. She entertained the kids, distracted them from it all. She played with them, it helped a lot.\n\u201cWe bought groceries and there was some food in the freezer, some meat, ravioli. That was the only time we went grocery shopping during the war.\n\u201cLater, when there was no electricity, no food, we grown-ups went hungry, and the children ate once a day and drank a glass of water between them. We didn\u2019t have normal water. The water was from the river, my husband got it under bullets.\n\u201cThey switched off the central heating, and it would get to minus 10 Celsius (14F) outside. One day, the shelling broke our windows, and the nightmare began.\n\u201cWithout the windows, it was 1C (34F) in the apartment. I spilled water once, and it froze. We didn\u2019t cover the windows with anything, it was so impossibly dangerous to go somewhere, to visit family.\n\u201cWe kept going down to the bomb shelter, until the very last day, the departure. Or we were in the areas between apartments on our floor, if there was no room in the basement. We put blankets on the floor and had a candle, sleeping on the floor for days.\n\u201cMy husband did everything, just everything so that we survived, so that the children and I wouldn\u2019t die. Food, water, he risked his life to get water together with neighbours.\n\u201cThe building had nine storeys. It was very vulnerable, yes. All the neighbouring buildings burned down or were destroyed. There were piles of bodies.\n\u201cBecause the place we were in was an active combat zone, it was constantly under fire. Four shells hit our apartment building when we were in there. One bomb broke out two floors of the neighbouring entrance. Three children and two adults died there.\n\u201cI saw shrapnel and held it in my hands. Neighbours collected it. Those were really heavy, tiny pieces, with very sharp ends, really scary. It seems like killing a human with one is so easy.\n\u201cAround March 7, our neighbours were killed in the apartment building [next to ours]. They were lying right there, in the courtyard, next to a rubbish bin.\n\u201cWhen the massive shelling began, our children withered. They talked very little, they sat around all day and zoned out.\n\u201cWe spoke to a psychologist. She said the children may have left the war, but the war is in them.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t express it in words, can\u2019t predict it. A plane flies, and you hear that sound, and it gets closer to you, and you just sit there and pray so that it [bombs] doesn\u2019t fall on you.\n\u201cThere was a moment of desperation. We were frozen, we were starving, and I went to our apartment to lie down. The moment I fell asleep, I saw through the blinds these, you know, lights.\n\u201cMy husband yelled: \u2018They\u2019re dropping some anti-air defence things, let\u2019s run.\u2019 But the second we stood up, it all fell next to the neighbouring house and our house shook. It was a plane, it dropped four bombs.\n\u201cOne night, we counted 37 air raids near us.\n\u201cEvery neighbour helped one other. They brought water to the elderly, boiled it in the kettle. The war united the neighbours, even those who used to be unfriendly to each other.\n\u201cAnd then there was, perhaps, the scariest moment of the war. We were sitting in the space between apartments in this pre-death condition. It seemed to me that everything would be over now.\n\u201cOur neighbour, a woman, was wounded in the face. There was a fight right next to our building, and a piece of shrapnel flew right into her face.\n\u201cWith all this blood, she was screaming.\n\u201cEveryone simply hid, wherever one could, some between the floors, some in the basement. The neighbours cried for help, but no one could come, because it was so scary to simply come out.\n\u201cWhen everything got quieter, some Ukrainian soldiers came. They would pick somebody up, their own or their kin. Our neighbours ran up to them and asked them to rescue the wounded neighbour.\n\u201cShe was lying at home for about six hours. Half of her face was gone, her skull bones were damaged. My husband and another guy carried her downstairs on a blanket, and the soldiers took her to a hospital.\n\u201cI was in touch with her. Because of the time she waited to get to hospital, six or eight hours, she lost sight in one eye.\n\u201cA fire for cooking and boiling water next to the apartment building was burning from the get-go. When the situation got so tense that it was impossible to leave, we lit it on the stairwell.\n\u201cWe boiled water on fire in the morning. When you wake up, it\u2019s cold, you\u2019re so impossibly frozen, you need a drop of warm water and some for the kids.\n\u201cWhoever woke up first started the fire. Between 4 and 5pm, there is another fire.\n\u201cThe real starvation began on March 3. The kids were asking for food, they were always hungry, and we grownups almost didn\u2019t eat.\n\u201cI saw with my own eyes that many people looted stores. Although we were hungry, our conscience didn\u2019t let us do that.\n\u201cIn the end, we left with several neighbours, a simple act of desperation. The neighbours came and said: \u2018Let\u2019s go, just anywhere. Whatever happens, let it happen.\u2019\n\u201cIn 15 minutes, we jumped in the cars and left without a thing. Before the war, my dad bought several canisters of gasoline. Our car remained intact only because it was in a garage. The garage saved our car and our lives.\n\u201cWe started driving, and since we mostly hadn\u2019t been out, when we saw the city, it was a nightmare.\n\u201cThis was the first time the kids were going outside and when we ran, bullets were flying around. I asked them to close their eyes so that their little eyes wouldn\u2019t get hurt, told them there were glass shards flying around.\n\u201cThey did, and I just led them across the pavement among the dead bodies. We got in the car, started driving, and on the way out of the city they saw a man, fully torn apart. Just a torso lying there.\n\u201cThey reacted horrifically. They didn\u2019t understand at first what was it. Then they did, and went hysterical. Horrified by all that.\n\u201cAnd everything in the city was covered with the letter Z and St George\u2019s ribbons [that symbolise allegiance to Russia]. We were just shocked, we thought there\u2019d been no pro-Russians in our city, but there were hundreds on the way out.\n\u201cThere was a line of cars, and the pro-Russians stood there, they kind of organised roadblocks there, one after another, every 50 metres (160 feet).\n\u201cThey greeted us with smiles. Gave my hungry kids bottled water from a looted Ukrainian supermarket, gave us a big jar of honey. Some looked like absolute alcoholics.\n\u201cTheir goal was to check the car. To fully check the people leaving the city, their correspondence, photos, maybe there was something suspicious, something they wouldn\u2019t like.\n\u201cWhat saved us was that we had almost no electricity for three weeks. That\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t check our phones, the batteries were empty. And thank God, I am sure that\u2019s what simply saved our lives.\n\u201cThere were roadblocks all the way to the town of Orikhiv [160km (100 miles) northwest of Mariupol].\n\u201cWhen we saw the first roadblock of Ukrainian servicemen, we wept with joy. We ran out of the car, hugged them, gave them the honey, and the cans, and the chocolate bars and that water.\n\u201cWhen we and the neighbours reached the town of Nikolske [23km (14 miles) northwest of Mariupol], we drove on alone. The rest went to [separatist-held] Donetsk or to [Russia-annexed] Crimea, or stayed in Nikolske.\n\u201cPeople were confused, people were really scared. Some just sat by the side of the road, they simply didn\u2019t know what to do and where to go. It was all caused by fear, everyone was too scared to drive to Ukraine-controlled areas. On the road, nobody was overtaking.\n\u201cThe road we took was empty. For some 60 miles (97km), we didn\u2019t see a single car.\n\u201cWhen we entered the first city where everything was normal, quiet, where there was food and shops were open, we wept. When we went to a friend\u2019s apartment to wash hands, I saw hot water flowing, I just wept.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that it was water, it felt so precious, every drop seemed like it was made of gold. The simplest things, absolutely simple things such as water, electricity, central heating, we saw it all like a gift from heaven.\n\u201cWe arrived in the eastern city of Dnipro pretty late, got into a hotel, finally took a bath, ate normally. My son said: \u2018Mum, this is the world\u2019s best hotel!\u2019\n\u201cThe kids slept one night and half a day. They came to life, and said: \u2018Will there be any shooting here? Are you sure?\u2019\n\u201cNow, we are able to talk to my relatives in Mariupol, but they work for it. Those I am in touch with have no electricity. They can charge their phones, but they have to pay 20 hryvnia ($0.70) an hour.\n\u201cThe Russians started bringing food from nearby villages, there are makeshift markets. One can buy food provided you have the money, as the prices are above average.\n\u201cAnother problem with food is that the fridge doesn\u2019t work, you can\u2019t store food. Eat once \u2013 and that\u2019s it.\n\u201cPhysically, at this stage, they are feeling bad. Because there are no medical drugs, no quality water, well, no normal food.\n\u201cWhat do they say about the occupiers? Nothing good. The Russians create a make-believe image of normal life, open schools for children and entertainment centres \u2013 but the reality is people simply have no water, no food.\n\u201cThe Russians tried to restart the water supply, but the pipes leaked and flooded mass graves. There was a disaster. Because they did not bury the dead deeply enough, some body parts floated up. My dad saw it, he told me.\n\u201cThe house they live in now has no roof, just walls. And my apartment \u2013 I have none now, because a bomb fell on our nine-storey building.\n\u201cWe got so lucky.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: This monologue was lightly edited for clarity and brevity."

        "content": "Leaders of India\u2019s Hindu nationalist ruling party have instructed officials to be \u201cextremely cautious\u201d when talking about religion on public platforms after derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad drew protests from Muslim nations.\nTwo leaders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said verbal instructions were given to more than 30 senior officials and some federal ministers who are authorised to take part in debates hosted by Indian news channels often broadcast live to millions of viewers, the Reuters news agency reported on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want party officials to speak in a way that hurts the religious sentiments of any community \u2026 They must ensure the party\u2019s doctrine gets shared in a sophisticated manner,\u201d said a senior BJP leader and federal minister in New Delhi, according to the report.\nWith about 110 million members, mainly Hindus, the BJP is the world\u2019s largest political party, while Muslims comprise about 13 percent of India\u2019s 1.35 billion population.\nLast week, the BJP suspended its spokeswoman Nupur Sharma and expelled Delhi media cell head Naveen Kumar Jindal after Muslim nations demanded apologies from the Indian government and summoned diplomats to protest against anti-Islamic remarks made during a TV debate.\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran were among the nations that made their complaints public.\nThe influential 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said in a statement that the insults came in the context of an increasingly intense atmosphere of hatred towards Islam in India and systematic harassment of Muslims.\nOn Wednesday, Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian arrived in New Delhi for bilateral talks with India \u2013 the first visit by a senior minister of an OIC member nation after remarks on the prophet triggered outrage in the Arab world and other Muslim-majority countries.\nIran had summoned the Indian envoy in Tehran to lodge its protest against the anti-Islam remarks made by Sharma and Jindal.\nForeign Minister of Iran, Dr. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian arrives to a warm welcome in India. \nThe visit will further boost our deep historical ties and partnership. pic.twitter.com/Q1kn0sQsED\n\u2014 Arindam Bagchi (@MEAIndia) June 8, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, police in northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh arrested a BJP youth leader for posting anti-Muslim comments on social media, officials said on Wednesday.\nHarshit Srivastava was arrested in Kanpur city following communal tensions last week during a protest by Muslims to denounce the anti-Islam comments.\n\u201cWe arrested the local politician for making inflammatory remarks against Muslims,\u201d said Prashant Kumar, a senior police official, adding that at least 50 people were taken into custody following the tensions in Kanpur.\nSrivastava\u2019s lawyer was not available for a comment.\nSporadic unrest was reported in other parts of the country over the anti-Islam comments by the BJP\u2019s Sharma.\nIndia\u2019s minority Muslims have felt more pressure on everything from freedom of worship to wearing the hijab (head scarves) under Modi\u2019s BJP. There were Hindu-Muslim clashes during religious processions recently, following deadly riots in 2019 and 2020.\nAlthough the party has denied any rise in communal tensions during Modi\u2019s reign, the BJP rule has emboldened hardline Hindu groups in recent years to take up causes they say defend their faith, stoking a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment.\nThe US State Department, in an annual report on international religious freedom released last week, said that attacks on members of minority communities, including killings, assaults and intimidation, took place in India throughout 2021.\nIndia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday the offensive tweets and comments did not in any way reflect the government\u2019s views.\n\u201cWe are not barred from speaking on sensitive religious issues, but we must never insult the basic tenets of any religion,\u201d said senior BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal.\nModi in recent years has improved economic ties with energy-rich Muslim nations, the main source for India\u2019s fuel imports, but relations have come under stress from the anti-Islamic comments by the two BJP members, foreign policy experts said.\nSmall-scale protests erupted in parts of India as Muslim groups demanded the arrest of the suspended BJP spokeswoman.\n \n\n \n\n\n "

Tabas is some 550km (340 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran.\nRescue teams with ambulances and helicopters have arrived in the remote area where communication is poor. At least 16 people suffered critical injuries, with some transferred to local hospitals, officials said.\nThe derailment happened some 50km (30 miles) outside of Tabas on the rail line that links the city to the central city of Yazd. Photos from the scene, published by the Young Journalists Club associated with state TV, appeared to show train carriages on their side as rescuers tried to care for the injured.\nInitial reports suggested the train collided with an excavator near the track, though it was not immediately clear why an excavator would have been close to the train track at night. One official suggested it could have been part of a repair project.\nIran\u2019s worst train disaster came in 2004 when a runaway train loaded with petrol, fertiliser, sulphur and cotton crashed near the historic city of Neyshabur, killing some 320 people, injuring 460 others and damaging five villages. Another train crash in 2016 killed dozens.\nIran has some 14,000km (8,700 miles) of railway lines throughout a country about two and a half times the size of Texas. Its rail system sends both people and goods across the country, particularly in rural areas.\nIran also has some 17,000 annual deaths on its highways, one of the world\u2019s worst traffic safety records. The high toll is blamed on a wide disregard for traffic laws, unsafe vehicles and inadequate emergency services.\nIran, already straining under United States sanctions over its collapsed nuclear deal, has been mourning the deaths of at least 41 people killed in a building collapse in the country\u2019s southwest."

        "content": "Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has said it is suspending an agreement with Japan that allowed Japanese fishermen to fish near the disputed Southern Kuril islands, accusing Tokyo of failing to make payments required under the deal.\n\u201cIn the current situation, we are forced to suspend the implementation of the 1998 Agreement until the Japanese side fulfils all its financial obligations,\u201d Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement on Tuesday.\nCalled the Kurils by\u00a0Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan, the string of volcanic islands is at the heart of a decades-long feud between the two countries that has prevented them from signing a formal World War II peace treaty.\nMoscow regards the strategic archipelago \u2013 which separates the Sea of Okhotsk and Pacific Ocean \u2013 as its own, while Tokyo says the four islands belong to Japan and were\u00a0seized by the Soviet army in the final days of the war.\nIn October, Japan\u2019s new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said that Japan\u2019s sovereignty extends to the four islands: Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai, which lie at their closest point just a few kilometres off the north coast of Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan\u2019s main islands.\nThe Kremlin denounced that claim.\nMoscow\u2019s announced suspension of the fishing agreement comes as Japanese and NATO officials agreed on Tuesday to step up military cooperation and conduct joint exercises amid shared concerns that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is causing a deterioration of the security environment in Europe and Asia.\nJapan also quickly joined the US and Europe in imposing sanctions against Russia, including freezing the assets of Russian officials and billionaires, restricting trade and investment, and providing support for Ukraine, following Moscow\u2019s invasion in February.\nIn May, Prime Minister Kishida said Japan will ban Russian crude oil imports \u201cin principle\u201d and had already announced phasing out Russian coal imports.\n\nJapanese Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi said at the beginning of his meeting with NATO Military Committee Chief Rob Bauer on Tuesday that Japan hoped to strengthen ties with European countries and welcomes NATO\u2019s expanded involvement in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\u201cThe security of Europe and Asia are closely intertwined, especially now with the international community facing serious challenges,\u201d Kishi said.\nBauer\u2019s visit to Tokyo comes as Japan\u2019s Maritime Self-Defence Force is participating in NATO naval exercises in the Mediterranean Sea.\nAlso on Tuesday, Japanese and US fighter jets conducted joint flight drills over the Sea of Japan \u201camid an increasingly severe security environment, such as North Korea\u2019s repeated ballistic missile launches,\u201d Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defence announced.\nThe four islands at the centre of the dispute between Moscow and Tokyo are located to the southeast of the Russian island of Sakhalin and are administratively part of the same region.\nStrategically, control of the islands ensures Russia has year-round access to the Pacific Ocean for its Pacific Fleet of warships and submarines based in Vladivostok, as the strait between the islands of Kunashir and Iturup does not freeze over in winter.\nRussia has military bases on the archipelago and has deployed missile systems on the islands.\nWith a population of approximately 20,000 people, the islands are rich in hot springs and minerals and rare earth metals such as rhenium, which is used in the production of supersonic aircraft."

        "content": "An independent commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council after the 2021 Israeli assault on the besieged Gaza Strip said Israel must do more than end the occupation of land that Palestinian leaders want for a future state.\n\u201cEnding the occupation alone will not be sufficient,\u201d according to the report released on Tuesday, urging that additional action be taken to ensure the equal enjoyment of human rights for Palestinians.\nThe report cites evidence that Israel has \u201cno intention of ending the occupation\u201d.\nIsrael is pursuing \u201ccomplete control\u201d over what the report calls the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, which was taken by Israel in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move never recognised by the international community.\nThe Israeli government, the commission said, has been \u201cacting to alter the demography through the maintenance of a repressive environment for Palestinians and a favourable environment for Israeli settlers\u201d.\nCiting an Israeli law denying naturalisation to Palestinians married to Israeli citizens, the report accuses Israel of affording \u201cdifferent civil status, rights and legal protection\u201d for Palestinian citizens of Israel.\nMore than 700,000 Israeli settlers now live in settlements and outposts across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which is home to more than three million Palestinians. The Israeli settlements are fortified, Jewish-only housing complexes that are considered illegal under international law.\nLeading human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have equated Israeli policies against Palestinians to apartheid.\nThe UN inquiry and report was prompted by the 11-day Israeli military offensive in May 2021 during which more than 260 Palestinians in Gaza were killed, and 13 people died in Israel.\nIn May 2021, Hamas fired rockets towards Israel after Israeli forces cracked down on Palestinian worshippers in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound \u2013 Islam\u2019s third holiest site \u2013 where dozens were injured and detained. It also followed an Israeli court decision to forcibly expel Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood in East Jerusalem.\nThe inquiry\u2019s mandate included investigation of alleged human rights abuses before and after Israel\u2019s onslaught against Gaza, and sought to also investigate the \u201croot causes\u201d of the conflict.\nHamas welcomed the report and urged the prosecution of Israeli leaders in what it said were \u201ccrimes\u201d against the Palestinian people.\nThe Palestinian Authority also praised the report and called for accountability \u201cin a manner that puts an end to Israel\u2019s impunity\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the report \u201ca waste of money and effort\u201d that amounted to a witch-hunt.\nIsrael boycotted the inquiry, accusing it of bias and barred entry to its investigators to Israel and Palestinian territories, leading investigators to collect testimonies from Geneva and Jordan.\nThe report will be discussed at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council next week. The United States quit the Council in 2018 over what it described as its \u201cchronic bias\u201d against Israel and only fully rejoined this year.\nThe commission, headed by former UN human rights chief Navi Pillay, and is the first to have an \u201congoing\u201d mandate from the UN rights body.\nProponents say the commission is needed to keep tabs on persistent injustices faced by Palestinians under decades of Israeli occupation.\n"

Out of earshot for miles around, over the next five days and four nights, the two men raped her.\nEventually, they called her husband and informed him she could be found at a hotel half an hour from his house.\nOnce home, Divya\u2019s husband asked her to perform a \u201cpurity test\u201d. The ritual involved pulling a five rupee coin out of a pot of boiling oil \u2013 a \u201cpure\u201d woman would be able to pull the coin out without burning herself, her husband assured her.\nHe recorded a video of her attempting to pull the coin out. Within days, the video went viral in the village via WhatsApp and an activist stepped in to help Divya register a First Information Report (FIR), the first of many steps to see justice served.\nWhat happened with Divya is not unique. Crimes of a sexually violent nature disproportionately impact women and girls from India\u2019s less privleged castes, mainly Dalits.\nDalits, previously known as the \u201cuntouchables\u201d, fall at the bottom of India\u2019s complex caste hierarchy and have been facing discrimination and persecution by privileged caste groups for centuries, despite strict Indian laws to protect the community.\nAccording to the National Crime Records Bureau\u2019s latest data, there was a 45 percent increase in reported rapes of Dalit women between 2015 and 2020. The data said 10 rapes of Dalit women and girls were reported every day in India, on average.\nAccording to the National Family Health Survey 2015-2016 (PDF), sexual violence rates were highest among women from Scheduled Tribes (Adivasi or Indigenous Indians) at 7.8 percent, followed by Scheduled Castes (Dalits) at 7.3 percent, and Otherwise Backward Castes (OBCs) at 5.4 percent. For comparison\u2019s sake, the rate was 4.5 percent for women who were not marginalised by caste or tribe.\nHowever, these figures are \u201cmerely the tip of the iceberg\u201d, according to a recent report by the Dalit Human Rights Defenders Network (DHRDN), Tata Institute of Social Sciences, and the National Council of Women Leaders (NCWL).\nThe report, released in March this year, analyses access to justice by documenting the experiences of survivors of caste-based sexual violence in 13 Indian states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.\n\u201cCaste atrocities are not just based on caste; they\u2019re also based on caste and gender. It\u2019s Dalit women\u2019s bodies that become targets of violence. For the majority of Dalit girls, the extreme forms of violence they face is sexual violence,\u201d lawyer and rights activist Manjula Pradeep, also the director of campaigns for NCWL and DHRDN, told Al Jazeera.\nIndian law has special provisions for crimes perpetrated on people marginalised by caste and tribe under the Prevention of Atrocities (PoA) Act, including state support and special courts to streamline cases filed under the law.\nHowever, for cases to be tried under the law, survivors must first report these crimes to the police, following which an investigation occurs, and only then does the case go to trial. At each step, the report notes access to justice is limited for women from less privileged castes, especially in rural spaces.\nIn Pawar\u2019s case, her husband absconded \u2013 and remains so \u2013 but those accused of raping her were behind bars within six days.\nBut this was a rarity in cases where Dalit women have faced sexual assault at the hands of dominant-caste men. \u201cThis case might not have ever been successfully resolved were it not for the video,\u201d said Prachi Salve, the research centre coordinator at Manuski, an NGO that works with grassroots activists and victims of caste-based crimes.\n\u201cVictim shaming is common in these cases, there\u2019s a lot of pressure [on victims],\u201d\u00a0 said Salve. The victim shaming extends to the surrounding village, and, at times even the family members, she added.\nThis often means there will be no justice. Owing to their castes, said Salve, \u201cthese women are often farmers, labourers \u2013 they depend on [dominant] caste people for work.\u201d\nWhen pressure and threats \u2013 particularly in rural areas \u2013 are too much to bear, victims often leave home. \u201cTwo cases happened in Maharashtra recently where we were unable to trace the victims after being in constant contact with them initially,\u201d said Salve.\nVictim shaming when it comes to law enforcement, however, is especially troubling, Salve said. \u201cWhen I interact with the police, they [often] say it was the victim\u2019s fault.\u201d\nIn most cases, an FIR was registered only after the intervention of NGOs and activists, the report said. On average, according to the report, registering an FIR could take up to three months. Additionally, since medical examinations are carried out once an FIR is registered, these examinations often don\u2019t provide adequate evidence for the case in a court of law.\nMoreover, the FIRs don\u2019t guarantee justice.\n\u201cThe police don\u2019t listen to the survivor,\u201d said Sangharsh Apte, an assistant coordinator at Manuski. \u201cThey don\u2019t write the story completely as described by the survivor and they don\u2019t fill in the correct sections of the FIR.\u201d\nIn 15 percent of the cases\u00a0where survivors or families of victims were able to get an FIR registered, justice was stalled due to the police not including applicable provisions of the PoA Act.\nAs a result, grassroots activists and fact-finders from organisations such as Manuski become crucial in seeing such cases through to the courtroom. \u201c[We] fill out applications for addition of sections in the FIR when these are missing,\u201d said Apte.\nBharti Ghosh, a spokeswoman for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party told Al Jazeera that justice in cases of sexual violence \u201cmust be delivered at the earliest as justice delayed is justice denied\u201d.\n\u201cI am of the same opinion \u2013 whatever be the cause, it is the most grievous of offences and the offender must be punished in such a way that brings relief to the victim,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when the law says equal opportunity for all, speedy justice must be there for all victims\u00a0 of this horrendous offence.\u201d\nThe PoA Act also requires investigations, including interviews with the victim, to be carried out on camera. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit expensive, but they have budgetary provisions for it,\u201d said Apte, but this \u201cprovision is often unknown to the investigating officers and the state machinery\u201d.\nAdditionally, the DHRDN report found that the rules of the health ministry\u2019s Medico-Legal Care Guidelines for Survivors or Victims of Sexual Violence were either poorly implemented or ignored altogether.\n\u201cAt the time of medical [examinations] confidentiality doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Salve, adding that \u201creports are carried out in general wards mostly by male doctors\u201d and \u201ctwo-finger testing is still going on\u201d.\nThe two-finger test is an intrusive unscientific examination used to detect a ruptured hymen. It was banned by India\u2019s Supreme Court in 2013. Of the survivors included in the report, 22 percent reported having undergone a two-finger test following a rape.\nThe report notes that the distance to the court for survivors \u201ccreates an additional financial burden\u201d for them and their families, adding that although the PoA Act requires that special courts be set up to try offences and \u201cto provide travelling and maintenance expenses during the investigation and trial\u201d, in practice these expenses are rarely provided to survivors, who are unaware of their rights.\n\u201cWe talk about fast-track courts, but it doesn\u2019t happen like that,\u201d said Pradeep. \u201cThere is a trial that\u2019s been going on for the last 21 years in Gujarat [in] a village called Pankhan [\u2026] she was asked to re-identify the accused, who had [gang-raped] her. Some of them have died.\u201d\n\u201cDespite there being huge allocations under the implementation of PoA, we do not see basic infrastructure in place like special courts, speedy trials, legal aid etc,\u201d activist and scholar Riya Singh, co-founder of Dalit Women Fight, an organisation that advocates for the rights of Dalit women, told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cFor the past two years, an amount of 600 crores ($77.4m) has been sanctioned under the Strengthening of Machinery for Enforcement of Protection of Civil Rights Act,1995 and the Scheduled Castes-Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. We do not know where this money is going,\u201d she said.\nLast year, Dalit activists noted discrepancies between the allocated and prescribed budgets for the welfare of the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes.\n*Name changed to protect the woman\u2019s identity."

        "content": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has promised to pursue accountability over the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh wherever facts lead, amid a heated dispute between Israeli and Palestinian authorities on how she died.\nThe well-known veteran journalist, a Palestinian American, was killed on May 11 as she was covering an Israeli army raid in the Jenin camp in the north of the occupied West Bank.\nAppearing at a forum for student journalists on the sidelines of a Latin America summit in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Blinken was confronted by Abby Martin, the host of the independent documentary and interview series The Empire Files. Martin asked why there have been \u201cabsolutely no repercussions\u201d for Israel, an historic United States ally.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, with respect, they have not yet been established,\u201d Blinken said of the facts behind the case.\n\u201cWe are looking for an independent, credible investigation. When that investigation happens, we will follow the facts, wherever they lead. It\u2019s as straightforward as that,\u201d he said.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/fIXXIDLJOVo\nBlinken, who has spoken to Abu Akleh\u2019s family, said: \u201cI deplore the loss of Shireen. She was a remarkable journalist, an American citizen.\u201d\nDozens of lawmakers from Blinken\u2019s Democratic Party have called on the FBI to lead an investigation to seek an impartial finding into her death. The US State Department, however, has said that it would trust Israel to conduct a probe.\nOn Monday, Senator Mitt Romney called on President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to push for \u201ca full and transparent investigation\u201d into the killing of Abu Akleh in a rare move from a Republican Party politician.\nRomney, the senator from Utah, sent a letter on Monday to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging the State Department to ensure accountability for Abu Akleh\u2019s killing, which caused global outrage and condemnation.\nPalestinian journalists and colleagues \u2013 including Al Jazeera cameraman Majdi Bannoura \u2013 who were with Abu Akleh when she died said she was killed by an Israeli sniper. A Palestinian probe said that an Israeli soldier shot her dead in what it described as a war crime. A CNN report, quoting witnesses, also said that she appeared to have been killed in a targeted attack by Israeli forces.\nIsrael has changed its story several times, ranging from denying the allegations, to blaming the killing on stray fire from Palestinian armed fighters, to admitting that an Israeli soldier could have mistakenly shot Abu Akleh.\nIsraeli authorities asked the Palestinian Authority to take part in a joint probe, and then announced that they will not investigate their own soldiers.\nIsraeli police attacked Abu Akleh\u2019s funeral procession in occupied East Jerusalem and beat pallbearers carrying her coffin with batons in scenes that spurred further anger and calls for accountability.\nAl Jazeera Media Network has assigned a legal team to refer the killing to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague."

        "content": "Former world squash champion Mohamed ElShorbagy is at the centre of a heated debate in his home country, Egypt, after he announced he was switching allegiance to England in a move that has brought both widespread sympathy and harsh criticism.\nEngland Squash, the national governing body for squash, announced Monday morning that the 31-year-old ElShorbagy, who had won more than 40 tournaments for Egypt throughout his 15-year sports career, has switched allegiance to England with immediate effect.\nAccordingly, the current world number-three squash player is due to play his first game under the English flag on Wednesday at the Necker Mauritius Open, a Professional Squash Association (PSA) World Tour event, which kicked off on Tuesday.\nElShorbagy\u2019s decision, although far from being the first made by an Egyptian athlete to play for other nations, took the country\u2019s sports scene, and beyond, by storm.\nIn comments he made to BBC Arabic on Monday, the athlete said the \u201cdifficult\u201d decision stemmed from the lack of support he found in Egypt, and from choosing a path that would enable him to advance his sports career.\n\u201cThe older you get, the more you need a team behind you. You need a doctor and a special coach in every tournament. These things were not available to me before,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI need support at this time in my career. England came to give me all I needed,\u201d ElShorbagy told BBC Arabic.\n\u201cI love my country, Egypt. The toughest thing regarding my decision is the young players who look up to me,\u201d ElShorgaby added.\nMeanwhile, Egyptian Squash Association President Assem Khalifa implied that ElShorbagy had planned this move for a while, saying that the England-based player had refused to take part in a number of tournaments on behalf of Egypt and that the association had provided him with backing.\n\u201cSince I have plenty of professional players, I have always excused ElShorbagy for not coming to play with our team. He has been staying in Bristol since he was 14 years old. He doesn\u2019t come to Egypt unless there is a tournament being played here,\u201d Khalifa said in an interview with local television.\nKhalifa also argued that younger squash players are prioritised when distributing the association\u2019s limited resources, as well-established players win financial awards on which they can rely.\nBorn in Egypt\u2019s coastal city of Alexandria in 1991, ElShorbagy began his sports career in 2006 and is considered one of the most decorated squash players of all time, claiming the world No 1 rank five times since 2014.\nHis prominence in the game has coincided with a two-decade streak of Egyptian squash players dominating the sport. Aside from Egypt\u2019s Ali Farag, the world\u2019s current No 1 squash player, nine others are on the PSA\u2019s top 20 list.\nAhmad Barada, who came second in the 1999 world championship and was key in inspiring generations of Egyptian players, described ElShorbagy\u2019s decision as \u201ca mistake\u201d but argued that he \u201cshould not be slaughtered by the media for it\u201d.\n\u201cThis player won 47 tournaments for Egypt\u2026 I\u2019m sad that he has left us,\u201d he said in a televised interview. \u201cHe needs someone to support him at this stage,\u201d he continued.\nMeanwhile, local newspaper El Dostor accused ElShorbagy of treason, using its Facebook page to criticise the young athlete, calling for him to be stripped of his Egyptian nationality and publishing a video titled: How much did you sell Egypt for?\nBut others say they can understand ElShorgaby\u2019s choice.\nEgyptian football goalkeeper Sherif Ekramy, while saying on Twitter that ElShorbagy\u2019s decision was \u201cunacceptable\u201d, added that the Arab world\u2019s most populous country was \u201cpaying a hefty price as a result of negligent, empty-minded, vision-lacking officials\u2026 Egypt has for years been left behind by its best brains and talents. Before we condemn those who left, hold accountable those who drove them away\u201d.\nIn his widely-viewed talk show, television host Amr Adeeb on Monday commented on the issue, addressing Egyptian squash officials: \u201cLet\u2019s be frank: you offered him nothing. You gave him nothing tangible that you can hold against him.\u201d\nElShorbagy could be facing an Egyptian player soon \u2013 his own brother Marwan, who ranks ninth on the PSA and represents Egypt \u2013 at the ongoing Necker Mauritius Open Tournament, if they both qualify for the semi-finals.\nThis article was written in collaboration with Egab"

        "date": "Published On 7 Jun 2022",
        "content": "Washington, DC \u2013 With the largest pro-Israel lobby group in the United States getting directly involved in electoral politics for the first time, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is leading a push to influence Democratic congressional primaries across the country.\nAIPAC and other pro-Israel groups are pouring millions of dollars into Democratic Party races, largely to bolster opponents to left-wing candidates, federal election disclosures show.\nWhile some Palestinian rights advocates fear these efforts may deter politicians from speaking out against Israeli abuses, they say it nevertheless demonstrates the broader gains of the Palestine solidarity movement in the US.\nJames Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute (AAI), a Washington-based think-tank, said the push before critical November midterms has come in response to a growing chasm on Israel between progressive Democrats and the party\u2019s centrist old guard.\n\u201cThey were losing [support] among progressives, and so, they decided that they would stomp them out with millions of dollars of ads instead of recognising that the split is real,\u201d Zogby told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cThis is not an issue that\u2019s going away.\u201d\nFor years, activists have complained about the unregulated flow of money in US elections and the undue influence it grants corporations and special interest groups over the democratic process.\nUnder US law, political action committees \u2013 commonly referred to as PACs \u2013 and individuals can contribute only limited funds directly to political candidates.\nHowever, in a 2010 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution give entities the right to spend unlimited amounts of money to oppose or support candidates.\nWhile limits on direct donations still apply, the landmark court case \u2013 Citizens United v FEC \u2013 unleashed a new, decisive force in US elections: super PACs, entities that raise millions of dollars and spend the money independently, for example, through ads, in support of a cause or a candidate with very few regulations. This allows for advocacy as long as the groups do not directly coordinate with campaigns.\nUntil this year, AIPAC had stayed away from direct electioneering; the group did not donate money to or endorse candidates as an organisation. \u201cThe mission of AIPAC is to encourage and persuade the U.S. government to enact specific policies that create a strong, enduring and mutually beneficial relationship with our ally Israel,\u201d the group says on its website.\nBut last year, the lobby group launched a PAC \u2013 AIPAC PAC \u2013 and a super PAC, United Democracy Project (UDP). Since then, it has used the PAC to encourage supporters to donate to its favoured candidates and transferred money directly to their campaigns, and used the super PAC to also back and oppose candidates through ads.\nWith this approach, critics of Israel \u201cfaced insurmountable challenges to winning seats in Washington\u201d, AIPAC PAC Director Marilyn Rosenthal told supporters in an email last month.\nAIPAC did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s requests for comment.\nSo far, after primaries in a handful of states \u2013 including key races in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Texas \u2013 before the November midterms, the results have been a mixed bag for AIPAC and its allies.\nWhile pro-Israel groups celebrated the election of several candidates, progressives have remained competitive and won a few races. Left-wing activists have been especially jubilant about the victory of Summer Lee in a Democratic House primary in the Pittsburgh area last month.\nLee, a Pennsylvania state legislator, survived massive late spending by pro-Israel groups that translated into attack ads against her.\nBut on the same night that Lee declared victory, AIPAC celebrated the win of three candidates it had backed with millions of dollars in North Carolina, including Valerie Foushee, who defeated Nida Allam, a local politician who was looking to become the fifth-ever Muslim member of Congress.\nIt remains unclear how much the spending by pro-Israel groups has influenced these contests. House primaries, where victory requires only tens of thousands of votes, are local in nature because of the relatively small number of voters.\n\u201cIn our very broken electoral system, money matters,\u201d said Beth Miller, political director at JVP Action, a political advocacy group linked to Jewish Voice for Peace, a Jewish-American organisation that supports Palestinian rights.\n\u201cIn a genuine representative democracy money would not play the role it plays here, but it does. And these anti-Palestinian groups are dropping a lot of money. And so, we can\u2019t pretend that that won\u2019t have an impact; it will.\u201d\nPro-Israel spending in US politics is not new. Organisations like NORPAC and Pro-Israel America have raised money for pro-Israel candidates from both major parties for decades.\nThe late billionaire Sheldon Adelson spent hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Republican politicians \u2013 including former President Donald Trump \u2013 with a focus on Israel policy. On the Democratic side, Israeli-American investor Haim Saban has similarly donated generously for the party\u2019s top candidates while advocating for unquestioning support for Israel.\nHowever, in recent years, Democratic primaries have become a major focus of pro-Israel groups. In 2018 and 2020, several progressive politicians supportive of Palestinian rights were elected to Congress, joining a handful of Israel critics already there.\nAlthough they remain a small minority, they are a vocal one. Once unthinkable in mainstream US politics, positions such as conditioning aid to Israel and accusing the country of committing apartheid are now being openly discussed in the halls of Congress.\nAnd because progressives who are championing these ideas are mostly elected in districts that are almost certain to elect Democrats, Democratic primaries emerged at the forefront of efforts to protect an eroding pro-Israel bipartisan consensus.\nIn 2019, advocates with links to AIPAC founded the Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) with the goal of maintaining the Democratic Party\u2019s pro-Israel policies.\nDMFI made headlines the following year when it ran ads against Senator Bernie Sanders \u2013 a vocal advocate of universal human rights, including those of Palestinians. The anti-Sanders material focused on his electability and health, not positions on Israel.\nThat strategy of not mentioning Israel would become the rubric for attacking progressives in an electoral landscape in which American voters do not rank foreign policy among their top priorities.\n\u201cWinning Democratic primary races in overwhelming Democratic districts won\u2019t change the partisan makeup of Congress, but it will determine whether more pro-Israel Democrats, or anti-Israel Democrats, are elected. It will determine whether today\u2019s small but potent anti-Israel Squad grows to become a sizable anti-Israel caucus,\u201d AIPAC said in another email to supporters last month, referring to a group of progressive women of colour in Congress.\nBeyond open seats and protecting pro-Israel incumbents, Israel lobby groups also appear to have set their sights on defeating some sitting members of \u201cthe Squad\u201c.\nLast month, a new pro-Israel PAC was announced, with the main aim of unseating Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan \u2013 the only current Palestinian-American member of Congress.\nIn its founding statement, first reported by Politico, the Urban Empowerment Action (UEA) PAC pledged to spend $1m to help Tlaib\u2019s main primary opponent, Janice Winfrey.\n\u201cUEA PAC\u2019s premier race will be in Michigan\u2019s 12th Congressional District, where the group plans to spend upwards of $1,000,000 on TV, digital, mail, radio, and print advertising to support Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey in her campaign to restore infrastructure, improve educational opportunities in the district, and support the Biden-Harris agenda in DC,\u201d it read.\nUEA PAC has said its purpose is to back candidates \u201cadvancing policies that will improve the lives of African-Americans\u201d.\nHowever, Bakari Sellers, a TV pundit and former South Carolina state representative, who is backing the PAC, acknowledged in an interview with Politico that Tlaib\u2019s criticism of Israel is \u201cdefinitely high up on the list\u201d of reasons the group is trying to unseat her.\nMoreover, one of the group\u2019s top donors so far has donated millions of dollars to Republican and pro-Israel campaigns and PACs over the years, Federal Election Commission (FEC) public records show.\nIn a statement to Politico, Tlaib\u2019s campaign called on the congresswoman\u2019s opponent to \u201cimmediately disavow and condemn this type of Big Money attack on our democracy\u201d. Al Jazeera was not able to reach UEA through an email address listed on its website.\nWhile AIPAC has officially thrown its hat into the elections ring, other groups with a similar mission have continued to spend money in opposition of Israel\u2019s critics.\u00a0For example, DMFI PAC is running ads against Congresswoman Marie Newman, who has signed on to numerous measures in support of Palestinian human rights.\n\u201cDMFI PAC only endorses Democrats. More than 55% of DMFI PAC\u2019s Independent Expenditure spending this cycle helped candidates of color,\u201d the group told Al Jazeera in a statement last week. \u201cOur endorsement and spending decisions are made based on the candidates\u2019 views on issues central to us: support for the Democratic agenda, which includes strong support for the US-Israel relationship.\u201d\nMeanwhile,\u00a0AIPAC\u2019s new PAC has endorsed dozens of Republicans who have refused to certify President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory \u2013 drawing the ire of Democrats and others who describe these lawmakers as \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d who attempted to overthrow American democracy.\nThe lobby group justified its support for these GOP legislators by saying it is a \u201csingle-issue\u201d organisation committed to strengthening Israel-US ties.\n\u201cAIPAC stands with pro-Israel Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders wrote on Twitter last month, criticising the group. \u201cThey stand with Republican insurrectionists who refused to certify Biden\u2019s election. But, mostly, they stand with billionaires who want a \u2018two-party\u2019 system that is united in support of large corporations and the rich.\u201d\nOther politicians have also gone on the offensive against the pro-Israel lobby.\nCongressman Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is running against fellow incumbent Haley Stevens after redistricting in the midwestern state, accused AIPAC, which is backing his opponent, of \u201cundermining our democracy\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about getting endorsed by AIPAC; it\u2019s about taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from them and then also taking money from other corporate PACs that also are supporting insurrectionist Republicans,\u201d he said during a debate with Stevens.\nAIPAC stands with pro-Israel Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0They stand with Republican insurrectionists who refused to certify Biden\u2019s election.\u00a0But, mostly, they stand with billionaires who want a \"two-party\" system that is united in support of large corporations and the rich. https://t.co/bws6ub9n1w\n\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 13, 2022\n\nPro-Israel groups are not the only super PACs spending heavily in Democratic primaries. In some instances, progressive candidates \u2013 mostly fuelled by small donations \u2013 have outraised their centrist opponents.\nStill, Palestine advocates have said the pro-Israel spending skews the conversation around Israel-Palestine and disrupts democracy.\nGeorge Bisharat, a Palestinian-American professor at UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, noted that most Americans support conditioning aid to Israel \u2013 a 2021 poll showed 62 percent of respondents supported such a move (PDF) \u2013\u00a0but the position is only embraced by a handful of members of Congress.\nHe said the gap between public opinion and official US government policy on Palestine, as well as on other issues such as gun control, shows that \u201cthe democratic will of the people is subverted\u201d by \u201chighly resourced and highly focused\u201d special interest groups.\n\u201cThat is a challenge for us all in implementing a foreign policy that is more humane, that\u2019s wiser, that\u2019s more just and that ultimately serves our interests better,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\nBisharat said the recent election spending could make politicians think twice before criticising Israel, but it will not curtail the wider trend of questioning Washington\u2019s support for a country that has been accused of committing apartheid against Palestinians by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other rights organisations.\n\u201cThe pro-Israel forces \u2013 especially the hardline \u2018support the Israeli government unconditionally\u2019 \u2013 that group realises that it\u2019s losing its grip on the people, and on the discourse,\u201d he said, citing the Harvard Crimson\u2019s recent endorsement of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as one example.\nFor her part, Miller of JVP Action said pro-Israel groups may celebrate winning a few races now, but in the long term, the enormous spending will hurt their cause.\n\u201cThey are showing very clearly to this whole country what their real priorities are and where their fears lie. They are showing that they\u2019re willing to spend millions and millions of dollars to desperately try to keep out anyone who will put actual people, working families, human rights, first,\u201d Miller told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cAnd I think that they\u2019re doing it in a way that is actually getting attention brought on to them that will harm them in the long haul and help the Palestinian rights movement.\u201d"
